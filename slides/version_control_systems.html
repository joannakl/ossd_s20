## Version Control System (VCS)

- What is a version control system (and don't say _GitHub_)?

--

  A _version control system_ (or _revision control system_) is a system that
records changes to a set of one or more files so that earlier versions of any
of these files can be restored at a later time. It is often used for managing
software, but it can be used for any types of files, such as  documentation,
web pages, graphics, artwork in general, and chapters of a book.

--

- Why do we need version control?

--

  Software is a precious asset. You spend hours working on it and need to
make sure you do not lose important work. Sometimes you make mistakes, overwrite
things, replace good ideas with bad ones, and so on. Version control allows us
to safely go back to different versions.

  Also, when groups of people work on the same project files, a version control
system helps  prevent lost or conflicting work. It tracks every individual
change by each contributor.

--

- What are some examples of modern version control systems ?

--

    - Git, see [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
    - Subversion (or Apache subversion, or SVN), see [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion)
    - Mercurial, see [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial)

    - beginner
    - intermediate
    - expert

## VCS Terminology

- __repository__

--

    A database in which changes are stored and from which they are published. <br>
    In a __centralized VCS__, there is a single, master repository. <br>
    In a __distributed__ or __decentralized VCS__, each developer has their own
    repository, and changes can be interchanged among repositories arbitrarily.

## VCS Terminology

- __remote versus local repositories__

--

  The repository in which you do your work is your __local__
 repository. A __remote repository__ is a  version of your project that is not
 your local repository. It is usually either  hosted on the Internet, on another
 network, or your own network.  It can even be on your local machine.

  Sometimes you are the owner of the remote repository, because you maintain it
on a website somewhere (such as GitHub), and sometimes the remote is maintained
by someone else.



---
## VCS Terminology

- __clone__

--

    To copy an existing repository from a (usually but not necessarily remote)
   server into a newly created directory on  your local machine.
  (Every version of every file for the history of the   project is copied by default.)

--

- __commit__

--

    To make a change to the project; more formally, to store a change in the version control database in
    such a way that it can be incorporated into future releases of the project.

    "Commit" can be used as
    a verb or a noun. For example: "I just _committed_ a fix for the server crash bug that people have been
    reporting on Mac OS X. Jay, could you please review the _commit_ and check that I'm not misusing the
    allocator there?"
--

- __commit message__ or __log message__

--

    Some commentary attached to each commit, describing the nature and purpose
    of the commit. The more detailed it is, the better it is.

---
## VCS Terminology


- __push__

--

    To publish a commit to a remote repository, usually so that others can
 incorporate it into their copy of the project's code.

    In some VCSs, the remote repository is pre-determined, in others it is user-specified.

--

- __pull__ / update

--

    To incorporate changes/commits present in a remote repository into your own
  copy of the   project.

--

- __working copy__ or __working files__

--

    A developer's private directory tree containing the project's source code files.

    In a distributed VCS, working copies and repositories are usually colocated,
  so the term "working copy" is less often used. Developers instead tend to say
  "my clone" or "my copy" or sometimes "my fork".

    __NOTE__: The repository is not the directory or the files!  The repository is what
  the VCS creates to control and manage the files. We sometimes misuse the word but
  it is an important distinction.

---
## VCS Terminology


- __diff__

--

    A textual representation of a change. A diff shows which lines were changed and how, plus a few lines of surrounding context on either side. A developer who is already familiar with some code can usually read a diff against that code and understand what the change did, and often even spot bugs.

--

- __patch__

--

   A patch is essentially like a diff except that patches are often distributed as
  chunks of code that when run, make the changes to the file to which the patch is applied.

---
## VCS Terminology

- __branch__

--

    A copy of the project, under version control but isolated so that changes
   made to the branch don't affect other branches of the project,
   and vice versa, except when changes are deliberately "merged" from
   one branch to another (see below). Branches are also known as "lines of development".

    Branches offer a way to keep different lines of development from
    interfering with each other. For example, a branch can be used for
    experimental development that would be too destabilizing for the main trunk,
    or for working on new features, or for fixing bugs.

--

- __merge__

--

    To copy the differences found in one branch to another.

---
## VCS Terminology

- __merge conflict__

--

  When the same part of the file has been modified in two different ways a VCS may not
be able to merge the differences together. The changes may be within a single line
but they also can be more general than that. In this case, the VCS notifies the human
that a __merge conflict__ exists and must be resolved manually.

## The States of a File in Git

- Every file is in exactly one of three states in Git:
  __modified__, __staged__, or __committed__.

  __Modified__ means that you changed the file but have not told Git to record
  the changes in its database.

  __Staged__ means that you have marked a modified file in its current version
  to go into the next "commit snapshot".

  __Committed__ means that the data is safely stored in your local Git database.

--

- Files are either __tracked__ or __untracked__.

  Informally, a file in the working directory is __tracked__ if Git has a record of
  it in its database, whether it is  unmodified, modified, or staged.

  A file is __untracked__ if it is in the working directory but not tracked.

--

  When you first clone a repository, all of the files will be
  tracked and unmodified because Git just created them all for you, so they
  are all in its database, and you have not yet modified them.

---
## Making Changes with Git


- The basic workflow to modify a file and have Git record the changes:

  1. Make the changes to one or more files. These are changes to the
  working directory (the leftmost part of the figure.)

  1. __Stage__ the changes that you want to be a part of the next commit.

  1. __Commit__ all work that has been staged.


---
## Basic Git Commands: Installing

- Installing Git
    - This depends on your particular system. It can be downloaded from<br>
      https://git-scm.com/downloads

    - It can usually be installed by the package manager in Linux systems.



---
## Basic Git Commands: Configuration

 - Setting up your environment to work with Git in a terminal.

    - Set up your name / user-name / identifier

        `git config --global user.name "John Doe"`

    - Set up your email address:

        `git config --global user.email "John.Doe@worlds.net"`

    - Set up your prefered text editor:

        `git config --global user.editor vi`

    - Tell Git to cache your credentials for a few minutes, so you do not have to
    retype your username and password on every single push

        ` git config --global credential.helper cache`

    - Check your current configuration, i.e., list the config state:

        `git config --list`

---
## Basic  Git Commands:  Cloning a Repository

- The Git `clone` command makes a copy of an existing repository in a new
  directory, at another location. The original repository can be located on the
  local filesystem or on remote machine accessible through the Git protocol.

  - Given the URL of a remote repository that you have the right to copy, to clone it
     use

        `git clone URL`

      This will make a copy of the remote naming it with the same name as it has on
      the server, in the current working directory.

  - To clone a  repository on the local machine you also use `git clone` but give
    it the path top the existing  repository:

       `git clone PATHNAME`


  - In all cases it creates a `remote reference` named `origin` that "points to"
    the original repository and will be the default for pushing and pulling.


---
## Basic Git Commands: Repository Information

- Getting information about your repository (the local copy of it):

    - Show the working tree status (information about what is staged, what is
    tracked/untracked)

        `git status`

    - Show the list of all of the commits (i.e., the __commit log__) in reverse chronological order

        `git log`

    - Display detailed information about the  remote repository named `origin`:

        `git remote show origin`

    - Display a list of all remote repositories for your repository:

         `git remote -v`

---
## Basic Git Commands: Local Workflow

- After you modify some files:

    - Staging your files

         `git add file1 file2 ...`

    - Commit all staged files

          `git commit -m "one line commit message enclosed in quotes" `

    -  Or, selectively commit some staged files, say `file1` and `file2`

           `git commit -m "one line commit message enclosed in quotes" file1 file2`

--

- If you modify a tracked file, you can commit without staging.
  Say you modified `file1` after commiting.

    - Commit the tracked, modified file `file1`:

           `git commit -m "changed file1 again" file1`

---

## Basic Git Commands: Pushing

- You worked on your local copy of a repository and now want to update the
  remote, the one you cloned from. By default the remote is named `origin`.

     - To "push" those changes, in this simple case, you can use

          `git push`

        or for clarity

          `git push origin`

        For even more clarity, you are pushing your __master branch__ and can use

          `git push origin master`

---

## Basic Git Commands: Pulling

- Suppose that the remote repository might have been changed in some way since
  the last time you worked on your local copy. Maybe you added a file on the
  remote or someone else who had permission did so.

  You must __always__ retrieve the latest copy before starting more work locally!
  The simplest way to do this is to "pull" the changes.

  By default the remote is named `origin`.

     - To "pull" the current state of the remote, in this simple case, you can use

          `git pull`

        or for clarity

          `git pull origin`

  Later we will cover using `git fetch` as a safer way to do this.
