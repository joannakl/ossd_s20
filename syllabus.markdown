- [OpenSource.com](https://opensource.com/)  publishes stories about creating, adopting, and sharing open source solutions. It provides many resources for and about open source and the "open source way", as well as various other useful resources. The open source way is about applying the principles of open source software development beyond software

- [OpenHealthNews.com](http://www.openhealthnews.com/) publishes news, information and resources related to open health

- [foundation.mozilla.org](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/)
is the website of the **Mozilla Foundation**, a  non-profit organization
that is the sole shareholder in the Mozilla Corporation, the maker of Firefox
and other open source tools. Mozilla is involved in many initiatives to keep the Internet
free and open.

- [linuxfoundation.org](https://www.linuxfoundation.org)
is the website of the **Linux Foundation**, which is "dedicated to building
sustainable ecosystems around open source projects to accelerate
technology development and industry adoption."

- [code.gov](https://code.gov/#!/)
is the U.S. Government's **Code.gov** portal to the open source projects
maintained by the federal government. As they put it, it
"leverages the power of code sharing and collaboration to
help the U.S. Government cut down on duplicative software development
and save millions of taxpayer dollars for the American people."

# Grading  (exact grading rules subject to change by the beginning of the spring semester)
---

Your grade will be based on:

* preparedness / attendance / engagement: 10%
* blogs / reflective writing:  20%
* activities / exercises / homework: 10%
* individual contributions to open source projects: 20%
* group project (individual's contributions to the group  project): 30%
* in-class assessments: 10%

Here are the [details](grading.html) of how each category is going to be assessed and graded.

<!--
: exams and quizzes
* contributions (40%): these include contributions to existing open source projects both individual and in groups (details to be discussed at the
beginning of the semester)  
* homework (10%): weekly blog posts (answering homework prompts, reflecting on readings, contributions and activities), and other forms of homework assignments
* participation (10%): in-class discussions, in-class team work and report-outs
-->

Grades will be determined using the following scale:

        A   95-100
        A-  90-95
        B+  87-90
        B   83-87
        B-  80-83
        C+  76-80
        C   72-76
        D   65-72
        F   less than 65


The grade of *Incomplete* is reserved for students who, for legitimate and documented reason, miss the final exam. The grade of *Incomplete* **will not be given** to student who started falling behind in class. Those students should withdraw from the class or switch to *Pass/Fail* option.


# Academic Integrity Policy
---

I follow the department's
[academic integrity rules](http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity).

The nature of open source is based on collaborative work. But that work is still performed by individuals.
Your name should not be associated with a contribution that is not your own or that you have not put significant amount
of work into.



# Academic Email Etiquette
---

* Check the school email address on a regular basis. You can simply forward its content
to another email account that you use regularly.

* Use your school's email account to send emails to professors, instructors, TA's, graders,
administrators, etc. OR make sure that your email address contains your true name,
not "frabjous@gmail.com", "BabyGurl@yahoo.com" or some other cool alias.

* Start your email with proper salutations! Use the correct titles (Professor, Dr., etc.)
and spell first and last names correctly. If you are on the first name basis with your instructors,
use their names, not "Hey". For example: "Dear Professor Drummer" or "Dear Robert", not "Hey Bob".

* Sign your name under the body of your email, otherwise you expect people to read emails from anonymous.

* Do not write everything in upper-case letters. Do not write everything in lower-case letters.

* Make sure you included everything you wanted before hitting send. Don't send three emails
one after another because you forgot something in the first one.

* Proofread the text in your email before sending it. Most of the email clients check for
typos, but they cannot tell if your email makes much sense. Read it, before you send it.
